*June 1st, 2022*

I am thrilled to be graduating from Pitt with my Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering. This has been an incredible experience, and I am so grateful to my advisor, Dr. Chris Wilmer, my committee members, and all the friends and family that helped me through this journey. Please check out my dissertation: "[Computational Design and Analysis of MOF-based Electronic Noses for Disease Detection by Breath](https://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/43299/)"
