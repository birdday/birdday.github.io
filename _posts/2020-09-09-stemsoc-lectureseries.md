*September 9th, 2020*

Along with various other graduate students with the Graduate Student Organizing Committee (GSOC), I am pleased to announce the beginning of the STEM & Society Lecture Series, which will cover a broad range of topics about how the research we do impacts the world around us. Although organized by members of the University of Pittsburgh, all are welcome to join, simply follow the link to register. Join us for our first speaker and fellow chemical engineer, Emily Ackerman, as she discusses "The Accessibility Gap for Tech Users and Developers".
