During the 2019 IBM BlueHack hackathon, our team of ChemE PhD students from the Wilmer Lab (Myself and Kutay), Little Lab (Andrea and Ashlee),
and Li Lab (Aigerim) beat out 19 other teams for a second place finish with our idea, WeHaul Healthcare. The
hackathon was a two day business plan competition taking place on October 25-26th, 2019, with sponsors
from IBM, the Lash Group, and Pitt's Innovation Institute. Way to go team!
